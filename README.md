#  ðŸ§  RAG Pipeline â€“ End-to-End Retrieval-Augmented Generation System

The RAG Pipeline is a modular, production-ready framework that combines semantic search with large language models (LLMs) to deliver accurate, context-aware responses.
It integrates FAISS for vector similarity search, SentenceTransformers for text embeddings, and Groqâ€™s Llama-3.1-8B-Instant model for reasoning and summarization.

This project shows how modern AI assistants retrieve relevant knowledge from local data and use LLMs to generate precise, human-like answers â€” the foundation of many enterprise-grade applications such as document Q&A, knowledge chatbots, and intelligent search systems.
